```{r}
student<-read.csv('Q1a.csv',header = TRUE)

```

i. Plot , in each dept, how many students have scored above 9 SGPA
```{r}
s<-student[student$SGPA>9,c("Name","Dept.Name")]
s
plot(table(s$Dept.Name))

```

ii. Create subset of students , who have scored S grade in any subject and failed in any subject.
```{r}
sub<-subset(student,rowSums(student=="S")>=1 & rowSums(student=="F")>=1)
sub
```

iii.Find out average SGPA of each dept students.
```{r}
aggregate(SGPA~Dept.Name,student,mean)

```

iv.Find out average score of each subject for each dept.
```{r}
aggregate(Sub1~Dept.Name,student,mean)

```

v. Extract 10 toppers of each dept.
```{r}


```

vi. Sort students details of each dept separately.
```{r}
student[order(student$Dept.Name,student$Name),]
```

vii.Search for a particular student name in the data set, and retrieve his/her details
```{r}
